Treating it as a binary classification problem is like saying, \"at the moment that this customer has these features, what is the likelihood that they have already churned?\". But ideally, from a business point of view, we want to know WHEN *in the future* they will churn, not IF they have churned. We are asking a fundamentally different kind of question, so we need a different kind of model.\n",
    "2. If \"first\" is relative to a point in time (and not relative to when they started with the service), we expect customer A to churn first. The survival function is steeper near the first few months than a year on, indicating that customers are more likely to churn during their first year. \n",
